🧮 Arithmetic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator built in Java that supports basic arithmetic, scientific functions, and advanced percentage operations — with input validation and looping for continuous use.

🚀 How to Start the App

Install Java JDK 21
Download and install from the official Oracle site
 or use your package manager.

Run the Application
Navigate to the folder where arithametics_calculator.jar is located, then run:

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin\java" -jar arithametics_calculator.jar
💡 Replace the path above if your JDK is installed in a different location.

✨ Features
✅ Basic Math Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Modulus (%)

Power (^)

🧪 Scientific Functions

Square Root (sqrt)

Logarithm base 10 (log)

Sine (sin)

Cosine (cos)

Tangent (tan)

📊 Percentage Operations

Find X% of Y
e.g., 20% of 150 = 30

Percentage Change (A → B)
e.g., 50 → 75 = 50% increase

What % is X of Y?
e.g., 30 is 20% of 150

🛡️ Input Validation

Prevents crashes on invalid inputs

Handles divide/modulus by zero

Validates mathematical domains (e.g., sqrt of negative, log of non-positive)

🔁 Continuous Calculations

Automatically loops until the user exits

Easy to perform multiple operations without restarting the app
